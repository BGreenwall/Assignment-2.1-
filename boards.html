    <h1>  Network Security Objectives </h1>
    <p>  1. Create a network infrastructure design communications document that includes identified hardware components,
        connections to the outside world, identified physical layer connectivity (media) and addressing, including operational and
        security components in the design.<br>
        2. Install, configure and test security hardware and software tools with supporting documentation such as port scanners,
        vulnerability detection systems, intrusion detection systems, firewalls, system hardening, anti-virus tools, patch
        management, auditing and assessment.<br>
        3. Construct, implement and document a script or a program to automate a security-related process or other tasks such as
        installation, administration, management, mapping resources, logon scripts, patch management, updates, auditing,
        analysis and assessment.<br>
        4. Create a policy or procedure that addresses events such as: a disaster recovery plan, a business continuity plan, an
        incident response policy, an acceptable usage document, an information security policy, a physical security policy,
        assessments or troubleshooting procedures.<br>
        5. Develop a research report or implementation plan concerning legal and ethical best practices and mandated requirements
        that pertain to information security.<br>
        6. Research, document, test and evaluate several current industry information security-based threats, risks, malicious
